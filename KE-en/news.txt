President Donald Trump said in a tweet Sunday that he's working to give China's ZTE "a way to get back into business, fast."

Jobs in China are at risk, he said.

ZTE, a smartphone and telecom equipment maker that does business around the world, announced last week that it has halted its main operations after the Trump administration banned American companies from selling it vital components.
